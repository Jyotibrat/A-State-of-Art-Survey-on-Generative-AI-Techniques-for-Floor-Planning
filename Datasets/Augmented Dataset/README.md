# 🧪 Augmented Datasets

This directory contains a curated set of sample images from the **augmented dataset** generated as part of our project:  
***"A State-of-Art Survey on Generative AI Techniques for Floor Planning."***

These augmented images were produced using a custom data augmentation pipeline to enhance the diversity and robustness of the original dataset.

---

## 🗂️ Contents

- A small set of **representative augmented floor plan images**.
- Each image has undergone one of the following transformations:
  - Horizontal & vertical flips
  - Rotation (clockwise and counter-clockwise)
  - Gaussian blur
  - Grayscale conversion
  - HSV color space conversion
  - Brightness adjustments
  - Addition of random noise

---

## 📦 Purpose

The augmented dataset is intended to:
- Improve model generalization
- Increase the effective dataset size
- Introduce variability to better train generative models

---
