## 🖼️ Contents

There are **four sample floor plan images** stored in this directory. These were generated as part of different test cases using our trained generative models.

Each image showcases how the model interprets prompts and translates them into structured architectural floor plans.

## 🔍 Notes

- These images represent **qualitative results** and are included as visual references for the outputs produced by our system.
- Each image corresponds to a different test prompt or prototype variation.
