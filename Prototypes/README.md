# 🧪 Prototypes

This directory contains the prototypes developed based on our survey paper ***"A State-of-the-Art Survey on Generative AI Techniques for Floor Planning."*** These prototypes are practical implementations that showcase how different generative AI models can be applied to the domain of floor planning.

Each prototype demonstrates a specific concept or approach that has been discussed and analyzed in the survey paper.

## 📌 Description

- **[Prototype 1]()**: A basic Google Colab notebook that generates floor plan images from text prompts using Stable Diffusion v2.
- **[Prototype 2]()**: A standalone Python script version of the text-to-image generator designed for local or backend execution.
- **[Prototype 3]()**: A secure Google Colab notebook that uses Hugging Face token management via `google.colab.userdata` for safe image generation.

**These prototypes serve as working proofs-of-concept that bridge the theoretical insights from our paper with real-world applications in architecture and generative design.**
